# Recipes and Reviews Reserach Project
<p>The recipes and reviews research project is a course project for the course DSC 80 
(Practical Applications of Data Science) at UCSD.</p>

## Introduction

<p>. **The goal of the this project is to examine if health and diet focused recipes are more convenient to prepare.**</p>
<p>To address the question above, the project will work with two datasets. The datasets have been created by scraping information about recipes and reviews from [food.com](https://www.food.com/).</p>
<p>The first dataset called recipes contains information on recipes that were posted by users to food.com. The recipes dataset contains 83782 observations or recipes and 12 columns. The main columns that are relevant to our analysis include the time taken to prepare each recipe (minutes), the number of ingredients (n_ingredients), the number of calories, total_fat and other nutrition statistics (nutrition), and the (tags) column which has a list of short tags associated with each recipe. For instance, tags can include 'healthy', 'low-cholestrol', etc. which are a great tool to deduce which recipes are health and diet based recipes.</p>
<p>The second dataset is called ratings and contains information about reviews given to recipes on food.com. One recipe can have multiple reviews. The dataset contains 731927 observations or reviews and 5 columns. The main columns relevant to our analysis is the (ratings) column which is the rating given by a user to the recipe measured on a scale from 1 to 5 and the (recipe_id) column which will be useful while merging the datasets together.</p>
